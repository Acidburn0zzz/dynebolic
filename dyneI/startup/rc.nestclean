# This script is called to clean up the Nest at boot time. It is called
# after the nest is found, but before it is fully mounted, so the nest
# contents are in /mnt/nest/
#
# You can modify this file to change the default behavior if you have any
# special requirements.

# zap old logs
rm /mnt/nest/var/log/dynebolic.log
# clear out /tmp
rm -r /mnt/nest/tmp/*
