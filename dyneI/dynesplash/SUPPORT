The dyne:bolic developers rely on funding from
non-profit, grant-making and business
organizations willing to sustain development of
free software.

We can achieve the perspective of sustainability 
by offering the services of customizations,
workshops and setups; but also with a little help
from our friends.

We rely on support from individuals like you to
preserve, protect and promote the freedom to
share this distribution and software.

If you find dyne:bolic useful, please consider
making a donation today.

If you order it online, please do it from
redistributors supporting us, you'll find
a contact list of them on our website.

If you have a job, please encourage your
company to become a patron of the dyne:bolic
project.

If you redistribute it, please give us some shares
on sells: you'll be happy to see the new versions
coming out.
You can become an Official Redistributor and get
listed on our webpages: there you'll find more
informations about it.

We hope you understand how this is important to
to keep ongoing our ecosystem of generosity.

Thanks! a thousand flowers will blossom!</text>
