short notes on taschino, this documentation is still incomplete!


With nesting you have 3 possibilities to save your data and settings: dyne:bolic can nest on different media and in different ways, then detects the nest and activates it at every boot.

nest on harddisk

Nest your /home and all your settings, the nest can be password secured with encryption and doesn't needs repartitioning, to keep your data you just use a variable amount of space by creating one simple file: the .dynebolic.nest

nest on usb pen

Nest your /home and all your settings, it will place your /home directory and other settings in your usb pen filesystem and you'll be able to access them also from outside dyne:bolic system

nest on floppy

Nest your mail, bookmarks and encryption settings, reformatting your floppy with a compressed filesystem to have more available space


if you are interested in the concept of NESTING
refer to discussion going on http://lists.dyne.org/dynebolic
