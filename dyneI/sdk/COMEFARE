SYNOPSIS
=========
	COMMON TASKS:
 	-h show this help
      	-a start the entire process from beginning (WARN! will delete previous attempts)
      	-c already downloaded and untarred. chroot me!
 	-v show details
	particular purpose commands:
 	-f set flags (you must have allready an sdk installed)
	-i restart from initrd 
 	-x build Xfree86 (you must have allready an sdk installed)
	-d get latest baselayout-db and build it (you must have allready an sdk installed) 

DESCRIPTION
============

buildSDK is the main shell script file to launch. It downloads a gentoo stage1 and recompiles first the SDK 
system which will run chrooted when buildSDK launches a subshell script called createbasesystem (it's
included into the buildSDK script code). 
createbasesystem accepts most of the option passed to buildSDK and it compiles the whole dyne::bolic
in home/the_root/ into the chrooted SDK system. 
So you have a first stage install which chroots and recompiles itself. Then compiles and install into a 
subdir (using emerge and the ROOT env variable) the selected system.

Most of the options defines a stage of the installation to start from. 
	-a will start from the download of the first stage and will perform
	   the whole installation steps
	-c give to the user a chrooted shell into the SDK system. Usefull for adding 
	   parts and general debugging
	-f just modify the compilation flags and exit
	-i start the compiling from the base dynebolic system (the initrd one)
	-x start the compiling from the X11 and general /usr/ system (squashedfs)
	-d install only the dynebolic configuration part (/etc/ files mostly)

What you need before to start:
* Must be root
	$ su - 
* Have the squashfs support in your running kernel
	(refer to the kernel documentation: http://www.kernel.org)
* Have the squashfs user space programs
	refer to the proper site: http://squashfs.sourceforge.net
* Have 4 GigaByte of free disk space
	# df -h
* You need a broadband connection. A *DSL connection or better
* Must create a new working directory:
	# mkdir sdk
* download (or copy) buildSDK into the working directory:
	cp <where_is_the_buildSDK_file> sdk/

Usually to start a new installation you need to launch ./buildSDK -a into the working directory
The script will go on until it's over with the dynebolic compilation, which will be in your
	./dynebolic/home/the_root/

After the buildSDK has done its job, you can use mkinitrgz to extract into the <workingdir>/cdrom
the necessary initrd.gz and the squashedfs files.
Actually you need to compile the kernel on your own. The config file is avalaible from the 
dynebolic csv page: http://cvs.dyne.org .
Copy your kernel into the ./cdrom directory.
Launch dynesdk (follow the instruction you can read with the -h option)
You should have you iso ready to test'n'burn!

enjoy
