MuSE is an application for the mixing, encoding, and network streaming
of sound: it can mix up to 6 encoded audio bitstreams (from files or
network, mp3 or ogg) plus a souncard input signal, the resulting
stream can be played locally on the sound card and/or encoded at
different bitrates, recorded to harddisk and/or streamed to the
net. When sent to a server, the resulting audio can be listened thru
the net by a vast number of players available on different operating
systems.

commandline interface in the good old unix style.
