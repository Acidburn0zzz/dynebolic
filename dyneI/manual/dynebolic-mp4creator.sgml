       This  program  creates or modifies mp4 files. Supported operations are to
       add media tracks, add hint tracks, extract a track, delete a  track,  and
       optimize the layout of the mp4 file.

       Currently  the  program   understands  how  to import media from MP3 audio
       files, AAC audio files (ADTS), and MPEG-4  video   files.   These   original
       media files are known as elementary stream (ES) files in MPEG parlance.
