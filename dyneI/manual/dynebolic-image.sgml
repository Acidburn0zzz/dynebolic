<subtitle>2d and 3d graphic software included in dyne:bolic</subtitle>

<para>
The dyne:bolic distribution includes two eccellent programs to work
with graphics both on a 2d and 3d way: gimp for the elaboration of
bitmapped images and blender for the design and rendering of 3d scenes
also using server farms to share the elaboration between more computers
over the network. In fact dyne:bolic might come especially handy for who
wants to build blender server farms in a blink of an eye ;)
