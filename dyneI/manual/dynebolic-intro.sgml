<title>How to read this manual</title>

<para>
In this manual you will find several sections describing every single
application included inside the dyne:bolic distribution; together with
a description you'll find a small table giving you short informations
about the origins of each software and where to go to know more about
it. The table is structured in this way:
</para>



<!-- manual editors: use this table at the beginning of each
     application entry, compiled with the corresponding data
     ============================================== cut here -->

<para>
The homepage is of course a link which leads to useful information
about the usage, features, bugs etc.  If you are frequently using a
particular application, its always a good practice to subscribe to its
user mailinglist: there you can discover more about its development
and realize if any bugs that you encounter have been allready
addressed by developers. You can also get back to the dyne:bolic
mailinglist with suggestions on how to have a better inclusion of the
software in our distribution.
</para>

<para>
The manpage is the name of the manual page describing usage of the
program, you can use it with the <emphasis>man</emphasis> command from
an <emphasis>XTERM</emphasis> inside dyne:bolic :
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>man hasciicam</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>
it will show an higly informative text about the usage of the program;
the manpage name usually matches the name of the program executable
itself.
</para>

<para>
The author and year fields are documenting about author's identity and
the year in which software have started; it is often the case in which
older softwares are more reliable and developed.
