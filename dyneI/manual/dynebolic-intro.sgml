<title>How to read this manual</title>

<para>
In this manual you will find several sections describing every single
application included inside the dyne:bolic distribution; together with
a description you'll find a small table giving you short informations
about the origins of each software and where to go to know more about
it. The table is structured in this way:
</para>



<!-- manual editors: use this table at the beginning of each
     application entry, compiled with the corresponding data
     ============================================== cut here -->

<para>
The homepage is of course a link which leads to useful information
about the usage, features, bugs etc.  If you are frequently using a
particular application, its always a good practice to visit its
homepage and subscribe to its user mailinglist: there you can discover
more about its development and realize if any bugs that you encounter
have been allready addressed by developers. You can also get back to
the dyne:bolic mailinglist with suggestions on how to have a better
inclusion of the software in our distribution.
</para>

<para>
The manpage is the name of the manual page describing usage of the
program, you can use it with the <emphasis>man</emphasis> command from
an <emphasis>XTERM</emphasis> inside dyne:bolic :
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>man hasciicam</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>
it will show an higly informative text about the usage of the program;
the manpage name usually matches the name of the program executable
itself.
</para>

<para>
The author and year fields are documenting about author's identity and
the year in which software have started; it is often the case in which
older softwares are more reliable and developed.

<title>This is Rasta software</title>
<para>
Jah Rastafari Livity bless your freedom.
You should share this software for the good of yourself and your people,
respect others and let them express, be free and let others be free.
Live long and prosper in Peace.
</para>

<para>
But remember there is no Peace without Justice.
This software is about Resistance ina babylon world which tries to control
more and more the way we communicate and we share informations and knowledge.
This software is for all those who cannot afford to have the latest expensive
hardware to speak out their words of consciousness and good will.
This software has a full range of application for the production and not only
the fruition of information, it's a full multimedia studio and has nothing
to envy to other proprietary systems, because freedom and share of knowledge
are solid principles for evolution and that's where this software comes from.
</para>

<para>
The roots of Rasta culture can be found in Resistance to slavery.
This software is one step in the struggle for Redemption and Freedom.
Much blessings in Jah luv to all those who still resist. Selah.
</para>

<para>
You should read on this chapter if you are interested to know how this
operating system had birth and who contributed to make it real. Here i
introduce myself, i'm writing this manual and i'm the mantainer of
dyne:bolic, while i'm also the author of three softwares contained in
it: FreeJ, HasciiCam and MuSE.  My name is Denis "jaromil" Rojo, i'm a
south italian emigrant and <ulink
url="http://rastasoft.org">rastaman</ulink> lost in babylon, i code in
C/C++ since more than 10 years and have a decent experience of
multimedia development under GNU/Linux. I try to make a living out of
it, alltough is not my main reason to develop free software, and i
don't need much for myself to live happily.
</para>

<para>
My motivation in doing free software comes from the intention to give
people free access to comunication channels and to promote free
speech, against any form of censorship, adding my little effort to
break cultural and economical monopolies on information and
technology. Some other efforts i invest participating to projects like
<ulink url="http://italy.indymedia.org">italy.indymedia.org</ulink>
and with <ulink url="http://tazebao.dyne.org">collectives</ulink>
orbiting around it.
</para>

<para>
If you want to support my activity you can offer me ospitality, invite
me to give presentations, performances (i'm a photogenical
audio/visual performer, see what one must do to make a living today!),
<ulink url="https://rastasoft.org/donate.php"> make a donation thru
paypal</ulink>, <ulink
url="http://www.dynebolic.org/index.php?show=cust">pay me to customize
my software</ulink> to fit it to your needs or to help you using it,
invite me at dinner, <ulink
url="http://www.dynebolic.org/index.php?show=workshops">call me to
teach in a class</ulink>, help me to submit a grant, invite me to your
theatre company to work on multimedia setups (i've made a <ulink
url="http://dyne.org/perform.php">fairly good experience in
theatre</ulink> so far), encourage your company or organization to be
a patron of the dyne:bolic project.
</para>

<para>
Enough about me, now i'd like to mention the great support and help
given by <ulink url="http://www.autistici.org/loa/bomboclat">Federico
"Bomboclat" Prando</ulink> and <ulink
url="http://www.autistici.org/loa/c1cc10">Francesco "C1cc10"
Rana</ulink> for the development of dyne:bolic. Together with Liw they
are the authors of <ulink
url="http://autistici.org/bolic1">bolic1</ulink> which is another
bootable GNU/Linux distribution reduced to fit just in a small
cardsized CD and aiming to give slick tools to analyze and tweak
networks. The <ulink
url="http://www.hackmeeting.org">hackmeeting</ulink> is the place
where we met, it is also where they presented bolic1 spawning in me
and Lobo the idea of dyne:bolic.
</para>

<para>
Bomboclat and C1cc10 helped me to compile and configure dyne:bolic,
giving suggestions and testing it on hardwares. Most important thing
has been the great friendship between us which made it very funny to
meet and hack together on common projects.
</para>

<para>
I'm happy to mention here also the contribution of <ulink
url="http://sfrajone.org">Alexander "Smilzo" Gnoli</ulink> who
recently joined the project making dyne:bolic run on XBOX game
consoles, with the help of the documentation produced by a great
project: <ulink url="http://xbox-linux.sf.net">xbox-linux</ulink>. We
spend some time hacking together and sharing visions about dyne:bolic,
while he is planning to keep his focus on support for game consoles.
</para>

<para>
The following people also directly contributed to development: Lobo
(karma and knowledge), Sandolo and Rageman (scripts and tricks),
Nightolo and Rubik (MuSE interface coders), Maox (logo and graphics),
Eni and Newmark (watching horizons). I'm very sorry i can't say more
about them, alltough it would be worth, i know them fairly well and
they are all great hackers - probably i'll write more story here in
some future.
</para>
