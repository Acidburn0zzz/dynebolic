LiVES is the new Linux Video Editing System. It is designed to be
simple to use, yet powerful. It is small in size (under 2MB), yet has
many advanced features.

 Video
    * Loading and editing of most video formats (requires a working
      copy of mplayer).
    * Playback at variable frame rates, and in reverse.
    * Cut and paste of frames within and between clips.
    * Saving of selections, and individual frames.
    * Lossless backup/ restore.
    * Ability to 'play' with video - that is to move smoothly backwards
      and forwards through it, and to record yourself doing so.
    * Playback can use LiVES' own internal player, or you can instantly
      switch to mplayer.
    * Ability to open complete files, selections of files, and remotely
      located files (with mplayer libraries).
    * Real-time capture/recording of external windows.
    * Output to divx, asf, vob, vcd, mjpeg or mpeg1 or to any format
      using encoder plugins.
    * Resampling of video (time stretching) to any frame rate (.5 to
      200 fps); option to auto-resample between clips.
    * Rotation and resizing of video clips.

 Audio
    * Can work with mp3, ogg and wav files.
    * LiVES can also load tracks directly off CD to use with your
      video (using cdda2wav).
    * Ability to save audio selections, and append audio.
    * Sound can be trimmed to fit video selections.
    * Cutting and pasting of audio within and between clips.
    * Resampling of audio (rate, channels, sample size, signedness
      and endianness).; audio is auto-resampled between clips.

Effects
    * Many, including random zooming, colour cycling and colorisation.
    * Merging of frames: frame-in-frame, fade in/out and transparency.
    * Real time previews as the effect is processing.

Extras
    * Ability to play music through xmms (including random selection
      of tracks).
    * Midi synchronisation (stop/start).
    * Can load single images or directories of images and assemble
      them into videos or slideshows.
    * Toys !
