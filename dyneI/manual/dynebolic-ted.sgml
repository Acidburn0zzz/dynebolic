<para>
Ted is a text processor running under X Windows on Unix/Linux systems. Ted uses
RTF (rich text format), a document format supported by Microsoft(tm) word
processors, and various other applications, mostly (but not exclusively) on the
MS-Windows(tm) platform.
</para><para>
Ted is designed to be as compatible as possible with MS-Windows(tm)
applications. Every document produced by Ted should, without any loss of
formatting or information, be accepted as a legal .rtf file by MS-Word(tm).
Compatibility the other way is more difficult to achieve, but Ted will ignore
unsupported formatting. Ted supports font properties such as bold, italic and
underline, in-line bitmap pictures, postscript printing, tables, and symbols. It
can save documents in HTML format, and comes with built-in spell checking.
