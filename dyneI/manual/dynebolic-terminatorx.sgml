       terminatorX  is  a  realtime audio synthesizer that allows
       you to "scratch" on digitally sampled audio  data  (*.wav,
       *.au,  *.mp3,  etc.)  the  way hiphop-DJs scratch on vinyl
       records. It features multiple turntables, realtime effects
       (buit-in  as  well  as LADSPA plugin effects), a sequencer
       and an easy-to-use gtk+ GUI.
