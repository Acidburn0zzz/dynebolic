FreeJ is a digital instrument for video livesets, featuring realtime
rendering of multilayered video and chained effect filtering directly on
the screen. FreeJ threats every video source as a layer, making then
possible to dynamically apply on each a chain of filters, loadable as
effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are planned for rendering
of analog video input, digital movie files, image bitmaps, sound scopes,
texts and eventually more.
</para><para>
FreeJ is being developed in the hope to provide the GNU community with a
free, modular and highly customizable application to perform video
livesets, based on a GPL'ed framework that lets anybody implement his
own filters concentrating simply on the dsp algorithm developed and
furthermore to combine them over any supported layer.

The interface consists in a on screen display (OSD) reporting
informations like FPS, the filters that are created in the order they
are applied to the layer and some status messages.

LIST OF COMMANDS:
^ means CTRL key pressed
% means SHIFT key pressed

 GENERIC COMMANDS:
 PRINTSCR = display nice and lovely credits
 SPACE    = switch fullscreen mode
 ESC      = quits (without confirm)
 TAB      = turn on/off OSD
 ^TAB     = turn on/off calibration guidelines

 LAYER COMMANDS:

 PGUP/
 PGDOWN   = select layers up and down thru the chain

 ^PGUP/
 ^PGDOWN  = move layers up and down thru the chain

 HOME     = hide/show layer

 1        = select NORMAL BLIT
 2        = select BLU BLIT
 3        = select GREEN BLIT
 4        = select RED BLIT
 5        = select ADD BLIT
 6        = select SUB BLIT
 7        = select AND BLIT
 8        = select OR BLIT
 9        = switch alpha channel on/off
 0        = switch blank screen on/off

 %ARROWS  = move layers around thru the screen
 mouse-l  = drag layers around, slowly and smoothly

 FILTER COMMANDS:

 F1 - F12 = select an available filter (enter to create it)
            you can browse thru loaded plugins with this

 ^F1-^F12 = select the filter bank from which browse filters
            filters are stored in 12 banks, containing 12 filters each

 UP/DOWN  = select created filters up and down thru the chain
 ^UP/DOWN = move created filters up and down thru the chain

 DELETE   = remove selected filter
 ^DELETE  = remove ALL filters

 INSERT   = activate/deactivate filter
 (filters may have their own keys to change specific parameters)
 
 VIDEO 4 LINUX LAYER COMMANDS:
 k/m      = switch up/down input channel
 j/n      = (if TV tuner is present) switch up/down frequency tables
 h/b      = (if TV tuner is present) cycle up/down frequencies

 AVI LAYER COMMANDS:
 l/r
 arrows   = move one keyframe back and forward on the avi
 ^l/r
 arrows   = move many keyframes back and forward on the avi:
            left ctrl = 50000 ; right ctrl = 10000 ;
            left shift = 5000 ; right shift = 1000 ;

SOME FILTER COMMANDS:
(see the filter's sourcecode for details)

DelayGrab filter
q/w      = switch up/down delaymap
a/s      = increase/decrease blocksize

Vertigo filter
q/w      = phase increment/decrement
a/s      = zoomrate increment/decrement
z/x      = browse thru 3 modes (normal, artifarti, weird)

Simura filter
caps-lock + all letters = change color filters
keypad numbers = change mirror mode
