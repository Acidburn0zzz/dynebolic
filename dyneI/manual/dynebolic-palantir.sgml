<para>
       Palantir is a client-server streaming system designed to transmit live
       video, audio and data over a TCP/IP network, as well as to control
       remote devices.
       It is named after a word invented by J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien and
       mentioned in his tales, whose meaning is <emphasis>far-seer</emphasis>.
       The correct pronounciation requires the "i" in "tir" to be accented.

       Video streaming in Palantir was designed with performance in mind. Even
       a low-end machine can directly sustain the load of many hundreds of
       clients, without the need for an intermediate buffering server.
       Regular web browsers can display the live video stream which is produced
       in multipart jpeg format.
       The availability of a full-duplex, telephone-quality audio channel
       permits communication between server and one client at a time.
</para><para>
       A supplementary data channel enables clients to operate hardware devices
       connected to the server, as well as to get feedback from them and
       present it to the user in graphical form. Examples of these devices
       include pan/tilt/zoom machinery, flood lights, temperature sensors,
       strain gauges, etc..
