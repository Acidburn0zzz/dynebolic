       mplayer  is  a  movie player for LINUX (runs on many other
       Unices and non-x86 CPUs, see the documentation).  It plays
       most  MPEG/VOB, AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, OGG/OGM,
       VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM and RoQ files, sup-

       can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx,  DivX 3/4/5  and  even
       WMV movies, too (without using the avifile library).
