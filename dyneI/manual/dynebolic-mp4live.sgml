<para>
       This  program is a Linux audio/video capture utility that can capture and
       encode audio and video in real-time. The results can be written to either
       an  mp4 file,  transmitted onto the network via either unicast or multi-
       cast, or both simultaneously! The audio is encoded with MP3 or  AAC,  and
       the video with MPEG-4 Simple Profile which is OpenDivx compatible.

       The  program  has  a Gtk based user interface which displays a preview of
       the encoded video and controls to adjust the settings of the functions of
       the program. Settings are stored in ~/.mp4live_rc.
