dynebolic dockable binary system - see http://dynebolic.org

in this directory you find the files forming the dyne:bolic
system, which you can boot with a cd.



DOCK THE SYSTEM AND RUN FROM HARDDISK:
you can copy this /dyne directory folder inside the root
of your partition (i.e. c:\) to dock the system and make
it run from harddisk (goes much faster especially on xbox).

for more information about docking and dynebolic in general
please refer to the dynebolic user's manual available at
http://dynebolic.org/manual



INTEGRITY CHECK:
the md5 hash sums are unique numbers identifying the files
each hash sum is cryptographically signed by the mantainer
(see gnupg.org)
mantainer of this dynebolic release is jaromil /@/ dyne.org
you'll find his key at http://korova.dyne.org/jaromil.pub
and on http://pgp.mit.edu ID 0x5B6E6D97



RUN FROM HARDDISK:
if you have another GNU/Linux system already installed, you
can use the bootloader (grub or lilo) to start dyne:bolic
without the need for a floppy or CD: just have a new menu
entry to be selected at boot.

In the dyne directory you will find configuration entry files
for most popular booting systems: grub.conf and lilo.conf
append them to your configuration and edit as needed.

if you're online, this simple operation can be very quick:
lynx -dump dynebolic.org/lilo.conf >> /etc/lilo.conf
or if you have Grub
lynx -dump dynebolic.org/grub.conf >> /boot/grub/grub.conf

happy hacking! ;^)
