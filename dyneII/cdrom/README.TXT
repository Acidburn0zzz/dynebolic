   BOOT from a CD or DVD:
   You need to choose the CD as Boot-Device. With most computers
   you will have to enable "Boot from CD" in the BIOS. Please check
   your computer's instructions.
   If it doesn't works the first time, try to change the setup in your
   BIOS, most of the times you can access it by pressing DEL or F10 at
   the boot prompt (i.e. "press DEL to enter setup").
   Some computers will boot from CD when you keep the 'C' key pressed.

   Then you simply insert the dyne:bolic CD and reboot.

   BOOT from a FLOPPY:
   There is a boot-floppy image included in the cd directory floppy/
   inside you'll find also a program that lets you create the floppy,
   called rawrite. Prepare a formatted floppy and use rawrite to copy
   the boot image on it. Once done, copy the dyne/ directory in the CD
   on your harddisk, simply dragging it in C: for instance. That's it!
   dyne:bolic will now run from your harddisk booting from floppy.

   read the included manual (you'll find a PDF version in the CD)
