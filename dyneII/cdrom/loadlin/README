HERE YOU FIND HOW TO BOOT FROM A RUNNING MS-DOS or WIN95
 (without a bootable CDROM)

loadlin.exe is quite an ancient MS-DOS software
(released under GNU GPL)

it can boot a Linux kernel from a running Win95 or DOS system

you can use it to run dynebolic without rebooting
it can be useful on old systems that cannot boot from CD

you need to give it a path to two files into the isolinux/ directory:
the Linux kernel and the initrd.gz ramdisk
and you still need to have the dynebol.sys file at the beginning of
the filesystem of any storage device attached (harddisk or cdrom)

for more information see http://elserv.ffm.fgan.de/~lermen/
and the included files manual.txt, params.txt, initrd.txt
