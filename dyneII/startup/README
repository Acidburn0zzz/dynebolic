dyne:bolic GNU/Linux :: system startup files

here is all the file structure of the d:b startup sequence

the scripts are executed with zsh in sh emulation
anyway they should be generally compatible with bash

the startup/ directory is meant to be in the same directory where
sdk/ is, then the dynesdk script copies the files stored here inside
the system every time a dynesdk mkinitrd is executed.


this is all GNU GPL, see COPYING for further information
copyleft is stated on each single file.
