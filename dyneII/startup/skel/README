   Your user is root on the machine, which means you have full access to
   the hardware.
   Your /home directory is a Virtual File System mounted in your RAM,
   which can contain a limited amount of data.

   Harddisks are mounted in /vol, while /home/shared is a shared
   directory as a publicly accessible Samba folder.

   You are running XFree86 and WMaker as a window manager, your shell is
   Zsh and the kernel version you can see typing `uname -a` in a XTERM.

   If you don't understand what's written above then just go ahead, click
   the right mouse button on the desktop and surf thru all the programs
   and possibilities available, it's easy!

   There is a lot of multimedia stuff in this system, have phun ;)
