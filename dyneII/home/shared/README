This is the [dyne:bolic] shared directory

anything you place here will be accessible by others on your same network,
shared thru Samba and Ftp services.

this directory resides in your RAM memory, if you want to use harddisk space
you can change the default shared directory:

SAMBA: edit the file /etc/samba/smb.conf 

FTP: set the new directory for the user 'ftp' in /etc/passwd

share! share! shaaaaare! ;)
