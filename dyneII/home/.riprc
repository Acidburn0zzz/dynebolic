# ALTER THIS FILE AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN!

# But seriously, if you run into trouble, just delete this file
# and run rip once without any flags. That will recreate
# this file from scratch and set it back to defaults.

# ALL OF THE FLAGS IN QUOTES NEED TO BE FLAGGED BY A DASH '-'
# THE FLAGS IN QUOTES SHOULD LOOK LIKE THEY DO ON THE COMMAND-LINE

# These "default" flags will automatically be given to
# rip when you run it each time. These are WYSIWYG: meaning
# the quoted flags should look like what you normally
# use at the command-line, anyway. Basically, this variable
# is for people who are too lazy to alias commands. ;)
default = "-e -a -c -t -O -q 5"

# This sets the default flags used for lazy rips.
# Do NOT include the flags "-g", "-m", "-b", or "-q" in the variable "lazy"!!!
# The "-g" and "-m" flags are handled internally automatically!!!
# The "-b" and "-q" flags are set below by the variables
# named lazyBitrate and lazyQualityXYZ respectively!!!
lazy = "-e -a -c -t"

# This sets the default flags used for superlazy rips.
# Do NOT include the flags "-g", "-m", "-b", or "-q" in the variable "superlazy"!!!
# The "-g" and "-m" flags are handled internally automatically!!!
# The "-b" and "-q" flags are set below by the variables
# named lazyBitrate and lazyQualityXYZ respectively!!!
superlazy = "-e -a -c -t"

# Sets the default bitrate used by lazy/superlazy rips
# that use GOGO or BladeEnc as the encoder.
lzBitrate = 160

# Sets the default quality used by lazy/superlazy rips
# that use LAME or oggenc as the encoder.
lzQualityOGGENC = 9
lzQualityLAME   = 3

# Yes, that means lazy/superlazy rips which make use of
# oggenc or LAME always use variable bitrate encoding.
